Phase 4: Final Recommendations and Conclusion

This script translates the quantitative scores from Phase 3 into actionable,
human-readable recommendations. It loads the final segmented data, identifies
the top-performing coffee shops within each key segment, and prints a
formatted summary of the findings.

Key Steps:
1.  Load the final scored and segmented dataset.
2.  Classify each coffee shop into one of four segments based on median scores.
3.  Identify and rank the top 3 coffee shops in the primary segments.
4.  Print the final recommendations to the console.
